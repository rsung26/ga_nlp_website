#General Assembly WDI Project One
##GA-NLP: Natural Language Processing Website

Check out the site here: http://ga-nlp.herokuapp.com/

###About this Project

This website allows you to analyse the meaning behind language in an easy to use web interface. Using machine learning, you can type in text or the URL of a Tweet to classify them.

Natural Language Processing is a growing field. With the vast amount of data on the internet, Machine Learning Algorithms in this field have been on the rise. In my project, I found the Datumbox API to be incredibly accessible. Incorporating it into my project was simple, and the accuracy of the classifier was impressive. 

###Getting Started

To get started sign in or register. Then feel free to make any text entries or tweet URL entries. 
After those entries are created, you can apply some of the several types of Machine Learning Classifications available.
